# .Net-Vending-Machine-Application

This is an application I made over the course of iQuest Nagarro Remote Learning for .Net and is developed using Clean Architecture.

As database, it uses SQLite because I did not want something bigger as the scope of this application is to learn best practices when it comes to .Net Core.

For Depedency Inversion, Autofac is used.
In the future, it is planned to use Entity Framework as well.
